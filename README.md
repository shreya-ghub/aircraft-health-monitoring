**Aircraft Sensor Data Monitoring System**

A full-stack application that reads real-time aircraft sensor data from a CSV file, detects anomalies based on thresholds, and displays the results through a responsive React UI connected to a Spring Boot backend API.


Project Overview

This system simulates the ingestion and analysis of aircraft sensor data to help identify anomalies such as overheating, low fuel levels, and high engine vibration. It provides a clear visualization dashboard for engineers and analysts to monitor aircraft health in real-time.

 Motivation

Aircraft are equipped with hundreds of sensors. Ensuring that this data is collected, analyzed, and acted upon in real time is critical. This project aims to:
- Simulate a real-world sensor monitoring pipeline
- Detect anomalies for early failure prevention
- Demonstrate full-stack development with Java + React

 Tech Stack

 Backend
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot** – REST APIs
- **H2 Database** – In-memory data storage
- **Maven** – Build automation

 Frontend
- **React.js** – UI rendering
- **Axios** – REST API calls

Tools
- Git & GitHub for version control
- CSV for simulating sensor data
- Postman for API testing
